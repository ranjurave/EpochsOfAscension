# EpochsOfAscension

## Game Overview  
**EpochsOfAscension** is a sci-fi colony simulation and survival game set on a distant, hostile planet. Players will build and manage a colony, navigate alien threats, handle resource management, and overcome survival challenges. Utilize both first and third-person perspectives to explore, mine resources, construct bases, and withstand environmental hazards.
